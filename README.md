[h1]Mod Goals[/h1]
To add more fish to the original game. Freshwater, saltwater, and other aquatic life. This mod is meant to create more immersion, and add more to the ecosystem to the base game. We do not want the fish to make it easier to survive, so the percentage of catching, time to prepare, amount of fish fillets gathered, and fish weight are considered. 

This mod currently adds 39 unique fish, 20 tackle boxes, 2 Bug Catchers, Fishing Hook crafting framework, 4 Spinners, 4 Lures, 6 knives, 3 insects, 1 rubber bait, 2 fishing gloves, 4 fish themed hats, 4 fish themed tshirts, and 4 fishing rods to the game, which brings the total to 39 in game fish. That's a lot of variety.
